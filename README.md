#

### About it:

This repository is a Marketplace Project signed to me by Yoyo Sensei from Japan.

The main goal is creating a card game with marketplace format, making it possible to trade, draw and discard cards, show hand, build decks, score and eventually chat.

The rules for this project are:

- Only HTML, CSS and JavaScript are allowed;
- It is not allowed Frameworks;
- Bootstrap is allowed.

This same project shall be individually made using Vue.js framework in the near future as part of a programming Yoyo Sensei class.
