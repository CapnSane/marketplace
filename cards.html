            <strong>Hallowed Grounds</strong> is a card game that involves two or three players who are engaged in a battle of
            land domination. Each player has their own deck, either one previously constructed or made from a limited pool of
            cards for the event. All the players start the game with the <i>Castle</i> card on the board, which have 30 as their "<i>life
            total</i>" and loses the game when their life total is reduced to zero. A player can also lose if they must draw from an
            empty deck.
          </p>
        
            <h4>
              Cards in Hallowed Grounds
            </h4>
        
            <p>
              There are three types of cards:
            </p>
        
            <ul>
              <li>
                Castle
              </li>
              <li>
                Ground
              </li>
              <li>
                Brave
              </li>
            </ul>
        
            <p>
              The <i>Castle</i> type is the life total of a player, the very first card on the board and it has 30 of life in a
              total, called <i>Defense</i>. This card has two attributes, <i>Defense</i> and <i>Area</i>.
        
              The <i>Ground</i> type is the land where the braves battle. This card has four attributes, <i>Defense</i>,
              <i>Area</i>, <i>Capacity</i> and <i>Cost</i>.
        
              The <i>Brave</i> type is the soldier-like, that can attack or protect. This card has three attributes,
              <i>Defense</i>, <i>Attack</i>, and <i>Cost</i>.
            </p>
        
            <h4>Attributes</h4>
        
        
            <p>
              There are five card attributes:
            </p>
        
            <ul>
              <li>
                Attack
              </li>
              <li>
                Defense
              </li>
              <li>
                Area
              </li>
              <li>
                Capacity
              </li>
              <li>
                Cost
              </li>
            </ul>
        
            <p>
              Basicaly, the <i>Defense</i> attribute is the capabillity to defend an attack. The card is removed from the game when the
              <i>Attack</i> is greater than the <i>Defense</i>. Thus, the card that received the "damage" is discarded to the "discard pile".
              If the card is defending a castle from a direct attack to it, the card is not discarded because the attack was made
              against the <i>Castle</i>.
            
              The <i>Area</i> attribute is how many <i>Brave</i> cards can be stack over it. Only the Castle and Ground have this attribute.
              On the other hand the <i>Cost</i> is how much from <i>Area</i> the card take from.
            
              For instance, whether a Ground card has Area of 5, the player only can stack a total of 5 on the card, for example two
              card with cost of 2 and one with cost of 1.
            
              Lastly, the <i>Capacity</i> attribute is how many cards of that type the player can put on the board. Whether there are two
              cards in game with Capacity of 2, another one only can be placed on the board if one of these cards is discarded.
            </p>
        
            <h4>Attacks</h4>
        
            <p>
              Attacks can be executed against any type of card. If an attack is directed against a Ground card and there are Braves
              on it, the Braves shall defend the Ground with their Defense attribute. If the Ground is hit by an attack greater than
              the sum of defenses, the Ground is discarded and the Braves stay inactives until another Ground is put in game under
              them. In this case, the Braves can receive attacks and cannot be moved to Castle neither to another Ground.
            </p>
        
        
            <h4>Turns</h4>
        
            <p>
              The turns are basicaly when the player of the turn can draw the card and execute movements. The movements can be
              attacks or movement of troops going from a Ground to another one or to the Castle. The player can place in game as
              many cards as needed in this moment.
            </p>
        
            <h4>Decks and number of cards</h4>
        
            <p>
              There are three types of decks:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><span style="color:purple"><i>Dread cards</i> (purple)</span></li>
              <li><span style="color:darkgreen"><i>Holy cards</i> (green)</span></li>
              <li><span style="color:darkred"><i>Bloody cards</i> (red)</span></li>
            </ul>
        
            <p>
              The players can choose their deck cards freely, respecting the limit of 50 cards. <i>(The Castle is not counted for the
              number of deck cards.)</i>
            
              Mixed decks are for adventurers. When a mixed deck is created, only the cards with their respective card colours can
              be place on the <i>Ground</i> card, Brave cards in purple with Ground cards in purple and so on.
            
              To start the match, players need to shuffle the decks and draw 7 cards, each Castle is placed on the board and the
              player who starts the turn is decided by agreement between the players.
